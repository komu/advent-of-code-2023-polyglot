# Advent of Code 2023 - Polyglot Edition

Attempt to implement every day of [Advent of Code 2023](http://adventofcode.com/2023/) with a different language.

|                    Day                     | Solution                      | Language                 | Notes                                                                                              |

|  [1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)  | [day1.ts](src/day1/day1.ts)   | TypeScript's type system | Solution is calculated at compile time, results are provided in compilation errors                 |
|  [2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)  | [day2.pl](src/day2/day2.pl)   | Prolog                   | My Prolog is a bit rusty, so perhaps the solution is really a functional program written in Prolog |
|  [3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)  | [day3.sql](src/day3/day3.sql) | SQL                      | Tested on PostgreSQL                                                                               |
